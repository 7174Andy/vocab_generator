# Vocabulary Quiz Generator
As a software development, I felt obligated to eliminate any tedious burden of work. During my career at KAN Academy, I saw teaching assistants typing vocabulary quizzes one by one. For me, I thought computers can do this job automatically, and this is the motivation to initiate the project.

This program works in Terminal: The user should type the number of words in a single quiz, the name of the source document, and the range in the source document’s vocabulary list.

I constructed the automatic process program using Python’s RPA modules to write and read Microsoft Word documents.

This RPA program has decreased the time to create a single set of quizzes (three vocabulary quizzes and their solutions) by 90%
